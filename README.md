## Description

A web application focused on Movies! This is a throw back built from the
foundation of BLOCKBUSTER. Back when you used to look forward to going
out to pick up that new VHS release, which has now disappeared. Streaming
services has since killed the once beloved BLOCKBUSTER. Either way we
wanted to create a fun interactive site which allows users to be able to
research various movies, then can create a watch list and top favorite list.
Not to mention how many books were written and then made into movie,
how great would it be to search for that book too! If you don’t have wifi the
book for the win!
